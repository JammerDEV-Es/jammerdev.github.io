    "content": "I've been thinking about getting the eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester) certification to build a solid foundation in cybersecurity. At 16 years old, I feel this is a great step in my learning journey and knowledge, in this field. \n \n  The reason I’m considering the eJPT is that it offers a hands-on approach, meaning I won’t just learn theory I’ll be able to apply it in real labs. \n \n  This is crucial for developing skills that are actually used in the professional world, like penetration testing, vulnerability analysis, and troubleshooting security issues. \n \n As a starter license for €249, I think it's pretty good. And I don't think it will be too difficult for me to get this certification. I've done many labs from HTB, THM, and Vulnhub, so I won't have any problems. I've been doing this for a long time, this certification for me is just a way to stand out from the others who are new.",
