    "content": "I've been thinking about getting the eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester) certification to build a solid foundation in cybersecurity. At 16 years old, I feel this is a great step in my learning journey and knowledge, in this field.  The reason I’m considering the eJPT is that it offers a hands-on approach, meaning I won’t just learn theory—I’ll be able to apply it in real labs. This is crucial for developing skills that are actually used in the professional world, like penetration testing, vulnerability analysis, and troubleshooting security issues.",
